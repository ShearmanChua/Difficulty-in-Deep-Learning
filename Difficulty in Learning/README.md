# Difficulty of Learning for Deep Learning Models Experiments

This folder contains the experiments artifacts that were used to conduct the Final Year Project (Fintech related machine learning : experimental investigation on the effects of data variance towards difficulty of learning for deep learning models), the results that are obtained from the experiments, as well as the datasets that were used. 

There are multiple sub-folders contained within this folder itself. The sub-folders that contains the codes and experiments artifacts used to conduct the Final Year Project are stored in the folders titled:

- New variation 1 Experiments
- New variation 2 Experiments
- New variation 3 Experiments
- New variation 4 Experiments
- New variation 5 Experiments
- New variation 6 Experiments

The following sub-folders contains the results obtained from the various experiments carried out throughout the project:

- FYP Final Report Supplementary Results (supplementary results not included in FYP Report)
- New variation experiments results - combined (combined results and graph plots of all experiments conducted)
- Results for New variation 3 Experiments (Results for the variation 3 Experiments as it could not be included in 'New variation 3 Experiments' folder due to file path length)

The sub-folder that contains the codes used to generate the various datasets required for the various experiments for the Final Year Project:

- Code to Generate Dataset
